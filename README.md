# How to Install BetterDiscord Themes

By ZukeG

To be able to installs theme, of course, requires that BetterDiscord is installed preemtively.

Explaining how to install the different versions of BetterDiscord would make this guide unneccessarily long.

NOTE: Anything in quotation marks will not actually have quotation marks on the actual file itself, unless specified.

Once BetterDiscord is installed, you can download and install a theme. The only ways I know how to do this only works with windows, but I'm sure that there's a way to do it on a mac or Linux.

Steps:

  1. Download the theme's css file from "https://betterdiscord.net/themes/". (Or if you want a Captain Falcon theme, you could always just download the one I made here.)

      NOTE: Make sure that your theme's extension is ".theme.css" because BetterDiscord won't accept it unless you use that extension.
  2. Find the "themes" folder.

    NOTE:There's multiple ways to go about this.

      Way #1
      
        1. Go down to the search bar on the task bar or the address bar in your file explorer.
        2. Type "%appdata%" in the bar.
        3. Once you're there, look for the folder titled "BetterDiscord" and go into it.
        4. Go into the folder named "themes" and go into that.

      Way #2
      
        1. Open Discord, if it isn't open already.
        2. Do down to "User Settings" - the little gear icon next to your name.
        3. In that menu, go down to "BetterDiscord". (If it isn't showing up, you didn't install BetterDiscord correctly. If so, close down Discord and try installing again.)
        4. In "BetterDiscord", Go to the tab named "Themes".
        5. From "Themes", click on the button named "Open Theme Folder".
  3. Once the "themes" folder has been opened, open another file explorer window, and go into "Downloads" and find the css file you downloaded.
  7. Move the css file to the "themes" folder.
  8. Restart Discord. If you just click the "X" in the corner, that's not the way to shutting it down. It saves the progress of the window that was still open, and resumes it when you open it up. It doesn't load any new files when doing it this way. So you're going to have to shut it down through Task Manager manually (Ctrl+Shft+Esc) by ending the task. Then reopen Discord.
  9. Finally, to activating the theme. Go down to "User Settings" - the little gear icon next to your name.
  10. In that menu, go down to "BetterDiscord". (If it isn't showing up, you didn't install BetterDiscord correctly. If so, close down Discord and try installing again.)
  11. In "BetterDiscord", Go to the tab named "Themes".
  12. From "Themes", you should now see a theme's name, author, version, and description. (For Example, mine says "Captain Falcon v.10 by Zuke G - Show me your moves! In discord! Based off of Maple's Sleeping Beauty Theme!")
  13. If you see the correct theme parameters, then go ahead and click the Box labeled "Enabled" to enable the theme. (If you see a check mark in it, you're solid.)
  14. Exit the "User Settings" window by clicking "Done".
  15 Enjoy your new theme!
